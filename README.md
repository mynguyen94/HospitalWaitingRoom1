# HospitalWaitingRoom1
This program is written to help a hospital emergency room keep track of the patient lists in order for appropriate assistance. The hospital emergency room prioritizes patients waiting based on the severity of their need. The doctors in would see the next most critical patient rather than the one who arrived first. Larger integers are considered higher priority than smaller ones - The program is written using Red-Black Tree approaches => Build up a red black tree of patients => Insert a patient to the red black tree based on the priority code. Display the list of patients since the color might change after the insertion. => Search up a patient by their priority code. Then print out the corresponding information of the patient with the given priority code => Delete a patient from the BST. Display the list of patients since the color might change after the deletion => Make a sorted list of patients according to the priority codes. - The hospital emergency room waiting list always contains 20 patients. Each patient will be randomly assigned a distinct priority code. - Especially, the program must be dynamically and efficiently written in Java language.
